"God damn this stupid-" Arachnid let out a string of swears as her weapon malfunctions. She swept her fringe aside as it fell in front of her
eyes once again. 
She gave a satisfied smile as her weapon reboots again. 
"Hey, girl, go somewhere else." A voice grunted behind her. 

"Why should I?" Arachnid said, scowling, turning around. She expected to see one of those burly men who were wimps that beat up people to act tough.
Instead, a familiar face greeted her. 

"Calm down now girl," Rider says, letting out a light laugh, "Don't kill me please." He raised his hands in mock defeat. 

"Rider? I thought were meeting at 3? Am I late?" she asked, confused. 

"Check your phone." He says laughing. 

She turned on her phone, connecting to Rider's hotspot. What greeted her was about a hundred messages from the same person. 
"WE NEED YOU HERE NOW." 
"SEND, STUPID MESSAGE." 

The rest were basically of the same context. "Ah..." she say, realisation hitting me, "I should really get mobile data soon."
She looked up once she was done scrolling the messages. 

"Well, let's go."

Suddenly, Rider's motorcycle's radio went static. An unfamiliar voice appeared. "Rider! You there? You're needed for an emergency mission briefing! Bring Arachnid with you" 
it said. "Who the hell was that?" Rider said. Arachnid shrugged. "Guess that means teabreak's cancelled. I'll reroute the GPS to its origin. Then we beat up the guy that 
cost us our meal" Rider said, smiling. Arachnid nodded.
"Let's do that. Then we stop at Macdonalds. I'm hungry." she said.
