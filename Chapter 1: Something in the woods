  The helicopter flew over the clearing of the forest. The Vigilante, Urban, Casino and Arachnid jumped off, whereas the Rider was already there, bike still on fire. "Sup slowpokes,"
Rider taunted. Urban rolled her eyes. "I swear, u say that again and I'll use a fire extinguisher" she said. "Babe don't be mean." the Vigilante muttered.
  The search begun. "That bald guy said that the dude looked like a hermit without a face. let's look for that." Casino suggested. "This forest is So BiG. Split up lah, easier lai
dat." Arachnid added. Vigilante and Urban went to the North, Rider and Casino went South, and Arachnid and a few soldiers went West.

In the South:
  Rider and Casino saw no sign of a "hermit without a face", so they decided to rest and play poker under a tree. "Ummmm, dude, look up." Rider stuttered. Above them, various decapitated
bodies were found. Casino levitated up. He instantly recognised one of the bodies. "Hey, that dude Shaw is up here!" Casino shouted.

In the West:
  A rather scenic walk it was, but no creepy stuff, just a beautiful lake. They decided to rest by the lake and have a snack. A group of locals, sunburnt and malnourished, limped over.

still on fire. Suddenly, shadowy figures appeared around her. Holding curved daggers, they started attacking her.
  The Vigilante was transported into...a historic site? A group of tourists stood in front of a baroque church, admiring it.  It all seemed so... familiar. Then it hit him: It was the 
when his family was taken away in an earthquake overseas. "Dammit, this again?" the Vigilante thought. In a flash, the group of tourists disappeared, leaving him in a deserted town.
Suddenly, the ground started rumbling and shaking. The historic site started crumbling. From the crevices came out dark shadowy figures crawled out. Running towards him, they started trying to attack him.

In the South:
  "Shaw? That dead guy?" Rider asked. Casino nodded. "Not only him. All the people the bald guy mentioned are here. Or at least, what's left." Casino explained. Rider cringed. Opening a
