  The train interchange was surprising quiet that afternoon. Urban spray paints on the only train there. "Aaaaah. the satisfaction." she thought. A group of thugs 
appeared behind her. "There he is!" 1 screamed. Adjusting her ponytail, she took out 2 canisters. "Damn, we just met and you already got something wrong" Urban muttered.
  The thugs came closer. The hard rock started playing in Urban's earphones. "Give up lil gurl, it'll be less painful" a thug said. Smirking, Urban muttered "I'll beat u up first".
  They closed in on her. Spinning her canisters, she swung them around like nunchucks, knocking out one immediately. "1 down, 4 to go," she said, grinning. A train arrived at the interchange. Climbing onto the roof, the thugs struggled to climb on. The train moved again, running over the unfortunate thug who did not climb up in time. Another one bites the dust. "Daaaamn, that's gonna leave a mark."Urban commented nonchalantly. The 3 remaining thugs chased her. Backflipping onto the neighbouring train, she spray painted a thug's eyes, causing him to fall off the train and onto the tracks. A loud crack of a bone was heard as the thug screamed in pain. 2 challengers remain. Urban leaped to the rooftop of the neighbouring apartment. A thug didn't jump far enough, falling to the streets below. Screams and shouts of the passers-by filled the air as the last thug tried to take down Urban. After leaping through a few more apartment roofs, she reached the last block. A dead end. The thug fiddled with his knife. "It's over, little girl." he joked. "I think not, idiotic retard" she rebutted. Spray painting his eyes, Urban gave a strong kick to the thug, causing him to fall into the streets below.
  "Gosh that was violent. I better get going. i don't want another vandalism and tresspassing in my record" Urban thought. Suddenly, her Iphone went static. A man's voice was heard. "Calling all heros in the vicinity, we need your help" it said. "Guess that's where I'd be heading then" Urban thought. Hacking into the city's Internet, Urban ran to the location.
