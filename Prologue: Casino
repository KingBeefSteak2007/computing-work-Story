"Welcome to the grand reopening of Golden Aces Integrated Resort!" announced the host. Casino smiled. The resort was closed for renovations for over 2 months, causing him to be bored

The new rooms meant more customers, keeping him extremely busy. "Wanna draw another card? You seem don't confident with your deck" remarked Casino. "Sir, I'm always confident." said the
man, as he adds $300 to the pool. "I wish he'd tip more instead of betting more." thought Casino

Suddenly, the glitzy ballroom lights shut down. BOOM! A part of the ceiling collapsed. "Quick, evacuate the people! I'll handle this!" Casino said into his Walkie Talkie. "Noted. Good thing
we have a hero as our staff." said his collegue. The dust settled. 2 glowing blue eyes shone. A sleek, buff metal suit stood up.
