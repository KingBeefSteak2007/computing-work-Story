Quick backstory:
Lawyer by day, fighter by night. Losing his parents in an earthquake while on holiday, the Vigilante was adopted by the local Mafia. Realising that the Mafia's ways were inethical and cruel, he turns against them
and gets them arrested. However, his time in there had scarred him mentally. Using leftover gear from the Mafia and terrorists, the Vigilante became a hero for hire, killing criminals
and villains, drawing the attention of the police. Now on the run, he carries on his mission to fight crime underground.
