  Night.
  Gunshots filled the usually quiet neighbourhood. Two burly men in masks, firing aimlessly at an enemy they know they can't defeat. "He's closing on us Mack!" the first man, Luis, said. "I know!" Mack screamed. Their backs hit the dead end of the alley. In the distance, a dim light approaches. An urban legend among local criminals speak of a masked grim reaper, with flashing red eyes and  flowing ivory cape, wreaking lethal vengence on the lawbreakers without any due process. It's mechanical face will be the last memory its victim ever sees.
  Tonight, legends are reality. 
  A tall, cloaked figure stands menancingly at the alley enterance. The darkness covers its features, but its silouhette is enough to strike fear in the hearts of the guilty.
  A blinding red light flashes.
  Darkness.
  He comes closer.
  Blinks again.
  Closer.
  Blinks.
  Blade raised.
  Their screams pierced through the night sky. Birds flew away in fear. The Vigilante wipes off the blood on his blade. "Another stain. I gotta wash these off someday." 
he muttered. His watch rang. Notification from the local branch of the floundering Hero Department. 
  "Emergency mission briefing, arrive ASAP".
  Shrugging, the Vigilante walked away from the 2 headless bodies  in the alley.
